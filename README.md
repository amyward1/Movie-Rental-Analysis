# Movie-Rental-Analysis
This analysis dives into movie rental data from 2005 and 2006. 
The data was taken from the Sakila sample database on kaggle.com found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atanaskanev/sqlite-sakila-sample-database. 
The documents included in this repository show my work in python pulling the data, cleaning it, and my initial analysis and manipulations.
